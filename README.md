# Track 1: Dot-Com Boom

### 🎖️ Your **Challenge:**

Build a site inspired by the commercial ”.com” era of the early internet. You can either take a modern company and give it a 1990s or early 2000s-style makeover or recreate a classic business website from the past.

### ✨ Examples:

- Reimagine any modern business or concept as if it existed in the 90s.
- (If you are having trouble with that, recreate a site from a business that existed in the 90s.)

### ✏️ Grading Criteria:

- Does it clearly represent the company or idea, whether it’s a new design or a recreation?
- Does it capture the **aura** of the brand?
- Does the website look like it belongs in the 1990s/2000s?
- Does the final result fit the theme and feel complete?

### 💻 Suggested Tools and Tech:

- HTML, CSS, JS
- VS Code
- For advanced hackers: React, Next.js

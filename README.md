# holidayHackathon
This hackathon was hosted by Codedex.io. 

My interest was sparked because I have been following their socials for quite sometime and I wanted to participate in one of their events. 

Here's the theme of the hackathon:

### Track 1: Dot-Com Boom

### 🎖️ Your Challenge:
    Build a site inspired by the commercial ”.com” era of the early internet. You can either take a modern company and give it a 1990s or early 2000s-style makeover or recreate a classic business website from the past.

### ✨ Examples:
    Reimagine any modern business or concept as if it existed in the 90s.
    (If you are having trouble with that, recreate a site from a business that existed in the 90s.)

### ✏️ Grading Criteria:
    Does it clearly represent the company or idea, whether it’s a new design or a recreation?
    Does it capture the aura of the brand?
    Does the website look like it belongs in the 1990s/2000s?
    Does the final result fit the theme and feel complete?

### 💻 Suggested Tools and Tech:
    HTML, CSS, JS
    VS Code
    For advanced hackers: React, Next.js
